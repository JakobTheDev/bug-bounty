# Bug Bounty

G'day, I'm Jakob, an AppSecEngineer from Australia, and welcome to my bug bounty repo ðŸ‘‹

This repo is a place for me to document and share my bug bounty toolkit and methodology.

I also build dedicated tools, including:

- [daneel](https://github.com/JakobTheDev/daneel) - A bug bounty bot.

If you want to read more about my bug bounty adventures, check out my [blog](https://jhakobthe.dev).

## Wiki

I'm documenting my bug bounty methodology as a wiki. You can find it [here](https://github.com/JakobTheDev/bug-bounty/wiki) or by clicking `ðŸ“– Wiki` above.


## Archive

I took a long break from bug bounty hunting, and have decided to start fresh in this repo. If you're looking for content that used to be in this repo, you can find it in the [archive](./archive/).
