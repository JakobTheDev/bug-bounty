## Tips
- Create a separate Chrome profile / Google account for Bug Bounty. Create dedicated BB accounts for YouTube etc. so you can get only relevant recommended content.
- However you do it, set up an environment that has all the tools you use, all the time.
- Use aliases and bash scripts to simplify commands you use all the time.
